                        <p class="card-text">Power metal was born out of the late 70s and early 80s. Dio was famous for his work
                        on Rainbow with his medieval, folk, fantasy, and sci-fi- themes. Robert Halford's high-pitched singing
                        would greatly influence the genre as well. Jon Mikl Thor would be one of the earliest influences as well,
                        inspiring Manowar. The Scorpions and Accept were two bands that would pioneer the genre in Germany,
                        the earliest movement towards European Power Metal. Yngwie Malmsteen and Kai Hansen were two big
                        influences in that genre as well as some of the greatest guitars to ever play. Helloween, the most
                        commonly cited power metal band, released Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I in 1987 and would spread the sound of European power metal around the globe. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">Power metal as a genre is focused on sci-fi, medieval, and fantasy-oriented
                            lyrics like those from Rainbow. The high-pitched singing as well as double guitars
                            of Judas Priest were also the foundations of this heavy metal sub-genre. Iron Maiden's epic
                            melodies would also add to the melting pot as well as Deep Purple's use of keyboards.
                            There would be many bands like Manowar, Gwar, and Gloryhammer that incorporated full costumes
                            set pieces to further their storytelling. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">
                            In the United States, power metal would draw influence from traditional metal as well as the
                            New Wave of British Heavy Metal. It would become faster, more energetic with a focus on riffs
                            but would drop the use of keyboards. There would be also be a widespread use of operatic
                            vocals such as Omen or Ayreon. <br>
                            In Europe, and the rest of the world, the European power metal scene started with the release of the
                            previously mentioned Helloween albums. They would introduce speed metal riffs with high-pitched vocals
                            and positive themes. Bands like Stratovarius would become more melodic with the use keyboards as well
                            as singing about personal issues whereas bands like Blind Guardian would overdub guitars and vocals
                            in order to create an epic atmosphere with lyrics rooted more in fantasy and legends.
